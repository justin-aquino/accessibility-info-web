          I worked as a chef for eight years, before deciding to switch careers
          and pursue programming. I know leaving the field you are used to can
          be daunting, especially when you're about to switch to a career where
          you have to start from zero again. So I am here to show you exactly
          how I started.

            <h4>Step 1: The Basics</h4>

            <p>
              The first step I took is watching youtube tutorials on the basics
              of programming. Number one on the list is <strong> HTML </strong>.
              HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard
              markup language for Web pages. It can easily be described as the
              skeleton of websites. I started watching and coding along to Brad
              Traversy's HTML Crash Course for Absolute Beginners, utilizing
              semantic and non semantic elements, creating a simple barebone
              HTML website. You can find this course for free on
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=3140s"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                aria-describedby="new_window"
                aria-label="A link to the free version of Brad Traversy's HTML Crash Course for Absolute Beginners video on youtube."
              >
                YouTube.</a
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              Another part of the basics is <strong> CSS</strong>. CSS stands
              for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to
              be displayed. I've always thought of it as the skin/ makeup of the
              website. CSS get access to HTML by the ids and classes designated
              to the HTML elements. I developed responsive static websites with
              galleries to practice flexbox and designing with CSS.
              <a
                href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                aria-label="A link to Flexbox Froggy, an interactive website to learn Flexbox."
                >Flexbox Froggy</a
              >
              is a clever and fun way to learn Flexbox. My tip is using
              percentage rather than px in sizing to make the website
              responsive.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now here is where it gets tricky. As someone who's so used to
              working in a kitchen where everything is muscle memory, I had a
              hard time grasping JavaScript. <strong>JavaScript</strong> is
              arguably the most used programming language for web applications.
              If HTML is the skeleton, and CSS is the skin, it's safe to say
              that JavaScript is the muscular system of the web. I tried
              multiple ways of how to start learning JavaScript: sandboxing,
              leetcode, books, but the best way for me to learn is coding along
              to tutorials on how to make JavaScript games such as
              rock-paper-scissors, tic-tac-toe, and typing games using DOM
              manipulation.

            <h4>Step 2: Fullstack</h4>
            <p>
              Now I wish I could tell you that you can break into tech with just
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, that is not the case. You need
              to equip yourself with fullstack tech. To be a fullstack developer
              means that you can develop
              <strong> both client-side and server-side softwares</strong>. The
              most common one you'll see in bootcamp is the
              <strong> MERN stack</strong>, and is sometimes complemented with
              another backend framework/language such as
              <strong> Ruby on Rails</strong>, or
              <strong> Django with Python</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way for me to learn is by doing, so I started making
              simple React apps such as a todo app for state management, a
              pokedex for react-router and fetching from third-party APIs.
              However, I felt that I have reached a plateau with self studying
              so I enrolled in a bootcamp to learn more about the MERN stack.

            <h4>Step 3: Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>
            <p>
              Sometimes, interviewers would have you make a simple app as a form
              of a take home assessment. But most of the time, technical
              interviews for developers are based on
              <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>. The main concern
              for bootcamp graduates is that the curriculum does not provide
              enough time to dive deeper into algorithms. In my 400+ hours in
              the bootcamp, I think we only spent about 5 hours studying DS&A.
              So when I got to my first technical interview a week after I
              graduated bootcamp, I stared into the hackerrank problem like a
              deer in the headlights. So to supplement my bootcamp education, I
              bought Colt Steele's

            <h4>Step 4: Portfolio</h4>
            <p>
              Another thing that helped me get noticed is my portfolio. After
              making projects, no matter how small, make sure you put it in your
              portfolio. Your portfolio does not have to be super complicated.
              Just a page where potential employers can see your past projects,
              your resume, tech stack and a contact form. My

                >portfolio</a
              >
              is made with ReactJS, CSS, and Bootstrap. It's easier for me to
              display my projects by storing the data in the state, and just
              mapping them throughout the component.
